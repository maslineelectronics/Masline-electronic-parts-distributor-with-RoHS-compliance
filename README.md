# Masline | Electronic Parts Distributor with RoHS Compliance

An electronic parts distributor with RoHS compliance ensures that all supplied components meet international environmental and safety regulations. RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) restricts the use of specific hazardous materials in electrical and electronic equipment. This certification guarantees that distributed components are safe for the environment, compliant with global directives, and suitable for responsible manufacturing.

Modern industries depend on environmentally conscious sourcing, and RoHS-compliant distributors play a vital role in supporting sustainable production practices while maintaining product performance and reliability.

## Electronic Parts Distributor with RoHS Compliance

The RoHS Directive originated in the European Union to limit the use of hazardous materials in electrical and electronic products. It aims to minimize environmental and health risks associated with the disposal of electronics by reducing toxic substances used in their manufacturing.

### Restricted Substances under RoHS
1. Lead (Pb)  
2. Mercury (Hg)  
3. Cadmium (Cd)  
4. Hexavalent Chromium (Cr6+)  
5. Polybrominated Biphenyls (PBB)  
6. Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDE)  
7. Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP)  
8. Butyl Benzyl Phthalate (BBP)  
9. Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP)  
10. Diisobutyl Phthalate (DIBP)  

RoHS-compliant distributors ensure that all components meet these restrictions, protecting both the environment and end-users from exposure to hazardous materials.

## Integration with Other Environmental Standards

RoHS compliance often overlaps with other global environmental and safety regulations. Distributors that maintain RoHS-compliant stock typically align with these additional standards to provide fully compliant solutions.

### Related Environmental Standards
- **REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals):** Focuses on chemical substance management.  
- **WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment):** Promotes recycling and responsible disposal.  
- **ISO 14001:** Environmental management system certification.  
- **Prop 65 (California):** Regulates exposure to hazardous chemicals.  

By integrating RoHS with these frameworks, distributors ensure consistent environmental compliance across global markets.
